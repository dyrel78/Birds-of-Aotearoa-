**Extra Features**

UI details: 
* When hovering over bird container, shadow will be the same colour as the conservation status.
* Hovering over bird image increases size, removes name, credit and colour circle.
* Clicking card will flip the card and display the bird's other names.
* Displays number of birds found for each filtered search.
* Sidebar button on top left of screen.
* Sidebar disappears when browser is <= 600 pixels

Minor QOL :
*  Responsive Design ( Number of bird cards changes depending on screen size).
*  Can search for birds via their other names.
*  If scientific name is too long, show elipses to symbolise this. You can then hover to see the full name. ( see shag )
   *  Makes for homogeneity amongst all cards.
*  Added Reset Button
*  Filter by various superlatives


**Unresolved Issues**
* Searching for individual card returns a card in the centre due to it starting at grid column 2, ideally should be after column 1 but doing so messes up formatting.
